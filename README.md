# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my digital portfolio for **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**.  
This repository documents my work at the intersection of **economic theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning**.

---

## About Me

I am an undergraduate Biology student pursuing a minor in Economics  
My focus is on building practical, data-driven skills while staying grounded in economic reasoning. I’m particularly interested in applying rigorous analytical methods to real-world economic and financial problems.

## About This Portfolio

This repository contains my **coursework, labs, and applied projects** from ECON 3916.

The course follows a **Concept Extension** philosophy:  
we start with foundational statistical tools used in economics—such as linear regression and hypothesis testing—and extend them using **machine learning methods** like regularization and model selection.

A core goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate how **causal inference** (understanding *why* something happens) can coexist with **predictive analytics** (forecasting *what* will happen). The work here reflects my effort to bridge traditional econometrics with scalable, modern data science techniques.

## What You’ll Find Here

- Applied econometrics labs  
- Machine learning extensions of classical models  
- Clean, well-documented notebooks focused on interpretation—not just accuracy  
- An emphasis on economic intuition alongside technical execution
